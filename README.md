Paper
===============
* k-Space Deep Learning for Accelerated MRI
  * Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging: [https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.03779]

Implementation
===============
* MatConvNet (matconvnet-1.0-beta24)
  * Please run the matconvnet-1.0-beta24/matlab/vl_compilenn.m file to compile matconvnet.
  * There is instruction on "http://www.vlfeat.org/matconvnet/mfiles/vl_compilenn/"
* k-Space Deep Learning (matconvnet-1.0-beta24/examples/k-space-deep-learning)
  * Please run the matconvnet-1.0-beta24/examples/k-space-deep-learning/install.m
  * Install the customized library
  * Download the trained networks such as image-domain learning, and k-space deep learning

Trained network
===============
* Trained network for 'image-domain learing for 1 coil and 8 coils on Cartesian trajectory' is uploaded.
* Trained network for 'k-space deep learning for 1 coil and 8 coils on Cartesian trajectory' is uploaded.

Test data
===============
* Iillustate the Fig. 6, 7, and 9 for k-Space Deep Learning fro Accelerated MRI
* MR images from 'http://mridata.org/' are uploaded to train and test.

For your own training
===============
